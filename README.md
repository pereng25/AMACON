## Integration of AMA4000 in THN Test Environment

This repository will contain different approaches to integtrate an AMA4000 (Pierburg Systems) in an exsisting enginge test rigt at the Technische Hochschule NÃ¼rnberg.

The first stage of this project will be to create a generic (and simple) communication platform over the "AK-Protocol" using the serial (RS232) port to exchange data between a host (Master -> PC, Raspi, you name it ;) ) and AMA4000. AMA4000 will serve as a slave respondig to the given commands.

Furthermore the connected Master device will serve as a bridgehead to the AMA4000 network, allowing all devcies in the test rig environment to access and control AMA4000.
